## ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ English Version

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective

The main goal of this challenge is to explore and learn the tech stack used by **Woovi**, a payment startup. I'm using this opportunity to:

- Practice full stack development skills
- Learn more about the architecture of modern payment systems
- Write clean, readable, and scalable code

## ðŸŽ¨ Challenge Theme

The proposed challenge is to build a **simple replica of a bank**, with the following features:

- Send a transaction
- Receive a transaction
- Calculate the available balance of an account
- Perform transactions between two accounts

This challenge is part of Woovi technical assessment process and is designed to demonstrate skills in software architecture, domain modeling, GraphQL API design with Relay, and full-stack development best practices.

## ðŸ“š Reference

This challenge is based on the official instructions provided in the following repository:

ðŸ”— [Woovi Challenge â€“ CRUD Bank GraphQL Relay](https://github.com/woovibr/jobs/blob/main/challenges/crud-bank-graphql-relay.md)

## ðŸ§° Tech Stack

This project is based on the stack used at Woovi:

- **Node.js** â€“ JavaScript runtime for server-side applications
- **TypeScript** â€“ Static typing for JavaScript
- **GraphQL** â€“ Declarative and flexible API
- **Relay** â€“ Meta (Facebook) framework for efficient GraphQL data handling
- **MongoDB** â€“ NoSQL document-oriented database
- **Jest** â€“ Automated unit and integration testing
