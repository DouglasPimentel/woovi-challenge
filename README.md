## 🇺🇸 English Version

## 🎯 Objective

The main goal of this challenge is to explore and learn the tech stack used by **Woovi**, a payment startup. I'm using this opportunity to:

- Practice full stack development skills  
- Learn more about the architecture of modern payment systems  
- Write clean, readable, and scalable code  

## 📚 Reference

This challenge is based on the official instructions provided in the following repository:

🔗 [Woovi Challenge – CRUD Bank GraphQL Relay](https://github.com/woovibr/jobs/blob/main/challenges/crud-bank-graphql-relay.md)

## 🧰 Tech Stack

This project is based on the stack used at Woovi:

- **Node.js** – JavaScript runtime for server-side applications  
- **TypeScript** – Static typing for JavaScript  
- **GraphQL** – Declarative and flexible API  
- **Relay** – Meta’s framework for efficient GraphQL data handling  
- **MongoDB** – NoSQL document-oriented database  
- **Jest** – Automated unit and integration testing
